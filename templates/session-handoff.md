## When to Create a Session Handoff

| Trigger | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Approaching context limits | Claude Code will notify you when context is filling up |
| Natural stopping points | Completed a feature? Reached a milestone? |
| Before switching tasks | About to pivot from backend to frontend? |
| End of work session | Future-you will thank you |
| Before major decisions | Document tradeoffs before choosing |

## Starting a New Session

1. Check `docs/session_handoffs/` for the most recent handoff
2. Read it for current state and pending tasks
3. Continue from where previous session ended

The transition takes seconds instead of the 10-15 minutes of re-establishing context manually.
